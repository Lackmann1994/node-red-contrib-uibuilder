# uibuild Template folder: Blank

This is about the simplest template you can get for uibuilder.

It does not use any frameworks and has no other dependencies.

It demonstrates that you can use uibuilder purely with HTML/JavaScript.

All it does is start up uibuilder and will dump any msg you send to it from Node-RED into the browser tab.
